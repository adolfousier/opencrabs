//! #1703 fix 3: the cron compaction boundary opens a run, it does not close it.
//!
//! Two vectors are covered here:
//!
//! 1. Seam parity - the boundary a cron run writes is recognised by the loader
//!    that reads it (`AgentService::messages_from_last_compaction`), and is a
//!    RESTART marker, not a delta segment.
//! 2. Death window - the rows a killed run left behind sit BEHIND the next
//!    fire's own boundary, so they are never reloaded as live context.
//!
//! Plus the structural pin: exactly one boundary per run, written before the
//! turn. A refactor that moves it back to run end, or that stamps both ends,
//! fails here instead of in production at 4am.
