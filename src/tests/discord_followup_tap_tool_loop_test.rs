//! Regression tests for the Discord follow-up suggestion tap (#1852).
//!
//! A message typed by a human runs the tool-loop display path: the flow
//! group opens immediately with its 🕒 clock, tool steps and narration fold
//! into it, approvals route to the buttons, and chained suggestions render
//! again. The tap used to ride the bare `send_message_with_display`
//! single-completion send — zero tools, zero progress events, zero
//! approvals — so the channel sat silent from the `▶️` echo until a plain
//! reply landed, and any action the suggestion asked for simply never
//! happened. These guards hold the wiring structurally, the same way
//! `slack_followup_tap_tool_loop_test.rs` guards #1838.

/// The tap branch must hand the turn to the tool-loop display path and never
/// call the bare interaction route again.
