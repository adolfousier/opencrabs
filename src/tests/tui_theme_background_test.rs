//! Canvas background coverage (#1634).
//!
//! `/theme` left the canvas untouched because `ThemeColors` had no
//! background field at all: 43 roles, none of them the surface the UI is
//! drawn on. These tests pin the field that fixes it, and the decision
//! that it stays optional so a theme can decline to paint and leave the
//! terminal's own background, transparency and blur intact.
//!
//! Every hex is pinned to the UPSTREAM spec, matching the convention in
//! `tui_theme_presets_test.rs`: drift from the canonical source fails here.
