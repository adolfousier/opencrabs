//! The compaction continuation document has ONE budget, shared by both sides (#1930).
//!
//! Observed 2026-10-04 (ops profile, live): the summariser request was allowed
//! `bounded_output_tokens(65_536, 200_000)` = 40 000 output tokens while the
//! input budget reserved a hard-coded `8_000 + 1_000` = 9 000 for it — a 4.44x
//! disagreement — and no code path trimmed the result. 208 of the 210 live
//! markers written that day exceeded a 3 000-token budget (mean 27.8 KB,
//! max 69.2 KB), and the worst session compacted 59 times in one day.
//!
//! Both sides now derive from the same arithmetic: the DOCUMENT budget
//! (`COMPACTION_SUMMARY_MAX_TOKENS`) plus a reasoning allowance for the request
//! (#1933). This test is the drift guard: it fails if either side re-acquires a
//! literal, which is the one edit that silently restores the 4.44x disagreement.
