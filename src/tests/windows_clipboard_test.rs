//! Windows clipboard support (#1822).
//!
//! Copy and paste in the TUI spoke only pbcopy/xclip/xsel. On Windows every
//! one of those spawns fails, so `copy_to_clipboard` fell through to its
//! `false` tail and the user got a silent no-op with the selection already
//! cleared — nothing to retry, nothing to explain. Paste was worse: the image
//! and text readers were compiled out entirely, so Ctrl+V had no backend at
//! all on the platform most of our users type on.
//!
//! The Windows arms shell out to PowerShell, so they cannot be exercised from
//! a macOS or Linux test run. These sentinels pin the wiring that makes the
//! path real (a backend exists, the Unix arms are gated so they cannot be
//! reached, and the two hazards that would hang or flash a console are
//! handled) so a refactor that quietly drops one fails here instead of on a
//! user's machine.
