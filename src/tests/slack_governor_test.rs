//! Slack outbound write governor (#2012) - the parity tests for
//! `channels/slack/governor.rs`.
//!
//! Same class of coverage as `discord_governor_test.rs` (#1910) with Slack's
//! shapes: the conversation key is a channel-id STRING, the 429 is
//! `SlackClientError::RateLimitError` carrying a parsed `Retry-After`
//! (slack-morphism 2.26), and the chrome writers are the step-group bubble and
//! its 4 s flow ticker rather than a Discord embed.
//!
//! Four of the tests drive the PURE `admit` / `note_429` functions: every
//! branch of the policy (drop, hold, charge, latest-wins park) is integer
//! arithmetic on `Instant`s, so an injected `now` proves it in one line with no
//! sleeping and no live socket. The remaining tests exercise the async
//! [`Governor::gate`] loop against the virtual clock in
//! `governor::test_support`, because that loop - sleep, re-ask, and the
//! park-expiry that ends it - is exactly where an async bug hides. The last
//! test pins the wiring: a Slack chat write that leaves the process without
//! paying the budget is the regression this issue is about.
