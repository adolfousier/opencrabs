//! Shared "turn ended but work is still running" helpers (#1985).
//!
//! The waiting-state logic was pure but lived in Telegram-only modules, so
//! Discord, Slack and WhatsApp re-derived it partially or not at all. This is
//! the shared home: it depends only on [`AgentService`] and its two registries
//! (background tasks, sub-agents) and never on channel types, so every channel
//! can fold the same two counts into one waiting phrase (#1987, #1988, #1989
//! build on this).
