//! The shared [`DiscordState`] struct: fields, `new()` and `Default`.
//!
//! Every field is `pub(super)` so the per-concern impl modules beside this
//! file (`approval`, `cancel`, `connection`, `pending_interactions`,
//! `sessions`, `tool_group`) can reach them without widening the
//! crate-visible surface. Behaviour lives there, not here.
