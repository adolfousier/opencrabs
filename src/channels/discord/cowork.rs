//! `/cowork` on Discord (#2015): the owner opens a channel or thread to its
//! members, the way `/cowork` opens a Telegram group.
//!
//! The write is `[channels.discord.channels.<id>]` with `open = true` and the
//! channel's `name`. Members are not registered anywhere: `open` already
//! admits them (#2014), so there is no per-member list to keep in step.
