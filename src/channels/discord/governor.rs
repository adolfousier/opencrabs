//! Outbound write governor for Discord (#1910).
//!
//! Telegram ships an explicit product-level policy layer
//! ([`crate::channels::telegram::governor`]); WhatsApp ships the simple shape
//! of one ([`crate::channels::whatsapp::rate_limit`], production-proven since
//! #1407). Discord had neither: the only protection against an edit storm was
//! serenity's built-in per-bucket ratelimiter, which is transport hygiene -
//! it queues the request, it does not know that this request is the fourth
//! re-render of a bubble nobody has read yet. Silent, too: a 429 here logged
//! as a generic failure with nothing separating "the API told us to slow
//! down" from "the message was deleted under us".
//!
//! Two surfaces make this acute: the tool-group bubble and the 4 s flow
//! ticker (#1843) that keeps rewriting its clock. A turn with eight tool
//! calls and a long-running command is one message edited every few seconds,
//! all of it cosmetic, all of it competing with the content that has to land
//! at settle. The governor's job is to make that competition ordered:
//!
//! - **Content is delay-never-drop** ([`Surface::Send`], [`Surface::Final`]).
//!   A ceiling breach holds the write until the budget refills, exactly like
//!   Telegram's G3 sends (#297). Past [`Limits::content_max_hold`] it fails
//!   open and lets the write go anyway: a late answer beats a lost one, and
//!   serenity's limiter plus a real 429 are still downstream.
//! - **Chrome yields** ([`Surface::Chrome`]). The ticker's clock line and the
//!   waiting-line refresh carry no information a later edit will not restate
//!   (every re-render paints the FULL current state), so a chrome write is
//!   DROPPED the moment it is refused: inside the spacing window, over the
//!   ceiling, or while the channel is parked. It never waits. That is
//!   Telegram's G2 drop ladder reduced to the one class Discord actually
//!   has.
//! - **A 429 is evidence, and the only real budget we are ever given.**
//!   Discord publishes no fixed per-route numbers and its docs forbid
//!   hardcoding them, so when a response names a `retry_after` window THIS
//!   layer honors it: the channel parks until the window closes and the
//!   ticker stops editing while it is parked. The config numbers are safety
//!   ceilings around that, nothing more.
//!
//! Like the WhatsApp limiter, all the math is synchronous and I/O-free in
//! [`admit`] / [`note_429`], with the clock injected as `now: Instant`, so
//! tests advance time by hand instead of sleeping. [`Governor::gate`] is the
//! thin async shell the call sites use.
