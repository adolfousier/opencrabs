//! Native Discord application commands for the Discord channel (#1850).
//!
//! `commands.toml` is the single source of truth for user commands on every
//! channel: Telegram renders it as the BotFather menu (see
//! `src/channels/telegram/menu_refresh.rs`), the TUI completes it, and the
//! `slash_command` tool executes it. Discord had no projection at all, so the
//! commands existed and were invisible: there was no `/` autocomplete and no way
//! to invoke them except typing the name into a message.
//!
//! Scope note: this projects `commands.toml` and nothing else. Telegram's menu
//! additionally lists built-ins and skills; Discord's list here does not, because
//! #1850 named the file rather than the whole catalog. Skills still work when
//! typed as text, through the normal message path. Adding them is a loop over
//! `brain::skills::load_all_skills()` in [`sync_commands`], and it would need its
//! own decision about which built-ins belong in a guild menu.
//!
//! This module is the projection. It turns the catalog into CHAT_INPUT builders
//! and pushes them with the *bulk overwrite* route (`GuildId::set_commands`,
//! which is `PUT /applications/{application.id}/guilds/{guild.id}/commands`), so
//! a sync replaces the whole set instead of creating commands one by one. That
//! distinction matters for Discord's budgets: the 200-per-day-per-guild limit
//! (`developers/interactions/application-commands.mdx:208`) counts per-command
//! **creates**, which bulk overwrite does not perform.
//!
//! Everything here is pure except [`sync_commands`], which takes the HTTP handle
//! and a guild list. Splitting it that way is what makes the grammar rules
//! testable without a Discord application, because there is no bot in CI.
//!
//! ## Name and description grammar
//!
//! Discord rejects a command whose name is not `^[\w-]{1,32}$` (lowercase, at
//! most 32 characters) or whose description is longer than 100 characters, and
//! caps a guild at 100 CHAT_INPUT commands with 8000 characters across the whole
//! command tree. The catalog is free-form text, so every one of those is a real
//! failure mode rather than a theoretical one. The rules are applied in order:
//! sanitize, then dedupe by the sanitized name, then cap, then tree size.
//!
//! Dropping is the only sane option where a rule bites. A rejected name would
//! otherwise take the whole sync with it, including every command that was fine,
//! so the bad entry is dropped loudly and the rest of the guild keeps its menu.
